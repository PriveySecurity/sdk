# Privey

Privey is a privacy-focused decentralized application (dApp) system built on Solana, designed to enhance transaction privacy and ensure strong unlinkability between deposits and withdrawals.

By addressing the transparency limitations of public blockchains, Privey enables users to interact on-chain while significantly reducing traceability and preserving financial confidentiality.

## Overview

Public blockchains expose transaction histories by default, making it possible to trace asset flows across wallets. Privey introduces a privacy-preserving architecture that cryptographically separates deposits from withdrawals, preventing direct on-chain linkage.

Privey is designed for users, developers, and protocols that require privacy, security, and scalability within the Solana ecosystem.

## Core Principles

- Privacy by design  
- Non-custodial fund control  
- Minimal trust assumptions  
- Solana-native performance  
- Modular and composable architecture  

---

## Key Features

- Deposit and Withdrawal Unlinkability  
  Cryptographic mechanisms ensure that withdrawal actions cannot be linked to original deposits.

- Privacy-Preserving Pooling  
  User deposits are aggregated to increase anonymity and reduce traceability.

- High Performance on Solana  
  Built to leverage Solana’s low fees and high throughput.

- Non-Custodial System  
  Users retain full ownership and control of their assets.

- Integration-Friendly  
  Designed to be composable with other Solana-based protocols and applications.

## High-Level Architecture

1. Deposit  
   Users deposit assets into the Privey system and receive cryptographic commitments.

2. Privacy Pool  
   Deposits are pooled to obfuscate individual transaction paths.

3. Withdrawal  
   Users withdraw assets using privacy proofs without revealing deposit origins.

This approach ensures strong unlinkability while remaining fully on-chain.
